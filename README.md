## 🌎 About the Project
**Address Converter App** is an backend application that let you input your ```.json``` file, with field **name of address** is required. It will read and convert that address name into ```Geolocation Postion: Latitude , Longitude ```. Then save down to your current input file and keep all the data structure the same as it before.

## 🎯 Purpose of the App
I am now developing an app called VAYA, which this application will **pin down all the national park in Thailand**, which currently have ~151 places with a datasheet of only name not geolocation for pining the marker in google map.

I am a lazy developer and need everythin to be automatic, so I created the converter to help with this job! Hope whoever find this find it useful!
It might not be accurate but most of the time it is!
